# About
Hello this is my lil blog i used -> [Fuwari](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari) to create this shit.

# My Life
My life is a mess to be honest. As a student I have changed my schools 5 times, right now I'm already studying at university. I'm very introverted person, you really think I'm kinda psycho when you meet me in person. But don't be afraid, I'm not that bad. I'm just a guy who loves to code and play games.

I can't shouw you much about myself, as i don't usually take pictures. but I will tell you about my hobbies in my blog.

I hope my findings about this World will be useful to you.

# My Studies
Currently I'm studying at [New Uzbekistan University](https://newuu.uz/). I'm majoring in Software Engineering and I'm trying to understand what the fuck is going on in that field. I hope in near future I will be able to understand it.

Before that nothing much happened in my life , I lived peacefully. Played games, watched movies, anime, hen...
