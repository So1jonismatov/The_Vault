# My Preferred Operating System
I use Linux. In particular I use Ubuntu with Gnome as my desktop environment. I really love the minimalism of the Gnome desktop environment, and I will be honest , i will choose Ubuntu over Arch or Fedora any day , because of the accessibility and ease of use. I dont fucking care if it is little bit performant or it is a true GNU licensed OS. At the end of the day, I just want to be able to use my computer without having to worry about anything else. only Windows , MacOs and very few Linux distributions can provide that level of accessibility and ease of use. trust me , I have tried many Linux distributions, and I every time i have returned to good old Ubuntu.

# Ok Why Gnome?
Gnome is my preferred desktop environment because of its simplicity and ease of use. It provides a clean and intuitive interface that is easy to navigate, making it a great choice for users who want a minimalistic and user-friendly desktop environment. Literally anything you want to do just press the Super key(windows button) and type the name of the application you want to open or file you want to search for. Anything can be done with a one click or a few clicks.

# Why not Windows?
I actually have secondary gaming laptop where i have Windows 11. But I don't use it as my main coding machine, as I prefer using Linux. On top of that Windows has a lot of bloatware and the file system sucks(NTFS is slow and takes a lot of space). I also prefer Linux because it is open source and free, which means I can customize it to my liking without worrying about licensing fees or restrictions. Additionally, Linux is more secure than Windows, as it is less vulnerable to malware and viruses. Finally, Linux is more energy efficient than Windows, as it uses less power and generates less heat.
