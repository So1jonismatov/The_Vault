# The Father of LoFi Hip Hop
You ever wondered why the quiet music is called Hip hop even though typical hip hop is loud and fast? It's because Nujabes, the father of lo-fi hip hop, combined *Jazz* and Hip-Hop. He owned a record music store and in his free time, he would listen to random music and get inspired. It is said that his music was a reflection of his own personal struggles and emotions, and he used his music as a way to express himself and connect with others. But I dont care about that. Sadly, he passed away at the age of 36.

Hereâ€™s a nice track:

        Light as a feather when I'm floatin' through
        Readin' through the daily news
        Measuring the hurt within the golden rule
        Centimetres of ether I'm heatin' the speaker
        Motivational teacher with words that burn people
        Seeing the headlines lined with discord
        It's either genocide, all the planet in uproar
        Never good but rules of paradise are never nice
        The best laid plan of mice and men are never right
        I'm just a vagabond with flowers for Algernon
        The average Joe who knows what the fuck is goin' on
        It's the hope of my thoughts that I travelled upon
        Fly like an arrow of god until I'm gone
        So I'm driftin' away like a feather in air
        Lettin' my words take me away from the hurt and despair
        So I'm keepin' it vertical forever elevator
        Ridin' the escalator to the somethin' that is greater
        So I'm driftin' away like a feather in air
        Lettin' my words take me away from the hurt and despair
        So I'm keepin' it vertical forever elevator
        Ridin' the escalator to the somethin' that is greater
        Taking chances, word tap dancing with wolves
        In an ice arena out there, deep in the woods of Arizona
        The sun be high, life's ironic
        Ain't tryin' to be Talib when I write
        Surreal life I paint it vivid habitat crazy insane
        Watch the propaganda six o'clock news that are saying
        Cultures clash for black folk and white trash
        They revel in the cyberspace that might crash
        Dash to millineum a million miles of runnin'
        At the speed of now back don't return gunnin'
        Rambo style gunho child gunnin'
        Ammo blao two times loud stunnin'
        Stunnin' when I hit ya lift you off the earth like
        Ayo, take you right back to birth
        And niggaz wonder why they might wonder why
        This shit might happen but it does, they go
        Driftin' away like a feather in air
        Lettin' my words take me away from the hurt and despair
        So I'm keepin' it vertical forever elevator
        Ridin' the escalator to the somethin' that is greater
        So I'm driftin' away like a feather in air
        Lettin' my words take me away from the hurt and despair
        So I'm keepin' it vertical forever elevator
        Ridin' the escalator to the somethin' that is greater
        Treat you better than me because that's the heavenly key
        To unlock the inner strength where my essence will be
        It's the knowledge of self understanding of the things around me
        That becomes the wisdom that I need
        Living this life to the best of my ability
        Channelling energy to my thoughts into your symmetry
        Remember me because my clothes remain gold
        I got the gift of gab like them pimps in Kangols
        It never ends I keep it rulin' like a cypher
        The first caveman bringin' fire
        Innovating and higher to blast mistakes I raise the stakes
        It's double or nothing in this vacuumless space
        I will survive, divine the time to cry
        Fuck a hold or hide I'm alive with pride
        And I drove the Chevy to the levy
        But the levy was dry singin', "This will be the day that I die"
